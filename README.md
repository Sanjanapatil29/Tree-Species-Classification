1.Recommend Trees by Location: Input latitude, longitude, tree diameter, whether the tree is native, city and state—and get the top 5 likely species for that location.

2.Find Locations for a Tree: Choose a species and see the cities/states where that species commonly occurs.

3.Identify Tree from Image: Upload an image of a tree. If it’s found in the dataset, it can predict the species and show common occurrence locations.
